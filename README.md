# xorencrypt
 a simple xor encryption implementation in c

 to run just run `make`  
 and usage is 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption, along with the plain text file and the cipher file names, and a name for the encryption key.  
 an example command would look like this:  
 `./xor e test.txt encryptedtest key`  

 feel free to use as you wish
